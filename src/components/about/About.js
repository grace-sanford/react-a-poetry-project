        Driven by the texture of words, React, a poetry project, is built on the
        premise that poems bring people together: to inspire, feel, and create.
        Integrating principles of minimal design, the app encourages visitors to
        slow down, observe.

        React, a poetry project utilizes TailwindCSS for utility-first styling,
        DaisyUI for easily refactorable components, react-beautiful-dnd for a
        drag and drop, and, of course, React and Redux for maintaining local and
        global state. Happy poet-ing!
